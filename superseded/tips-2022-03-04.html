                        Please remind your group members to be aware of the dress code, adjusting their cameras, and the setup of their workstations at home. For example, avoid only wearing underclothes, position the camera to ensure only the face and upper body are visible onscreen, and pick a quiet place to set up for the duration of the meeting. This will prevent embarrassing/uncomfortable situations and facilitate the group process.

                        Take the key features of the video teleconferencing platform being used into account when designing activities. For example, virtual meetings rely on video and audio to communicate. Social workers could take ideas from games that involve the use of pictures and sound to brainstorm new activities for a virtual setting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify mobile-text-align-left">
                        It can be helpful to incorporate body movements and actions into the games. “Ring the Phone”, as illustrated in the student sample video, is a great example of this.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify mobile-text-align-left">
                        Think about how to utilize pitch and intonation in designing games that target communication. “Two Truths and a Lie”, as illustrated in the student sample video, is a great example of this.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify mobile-text-align-left">
                        Social workers could consider the advantages of holding virtual groups, compared to in-person groups. Most of the group members are attending the group remotely at home, which provides the opportunity for social workers to learn more about and evaluate the home environment of their members. Try to increase engagement by asking participants to interact with other people or make use of items/objects in their space. For example, “Find and Show an Object”, as illustrated in the student sample video, invites group members to randomly pick an item at home and encourages them to share it with others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify mobile-text-align-left">
                        In addition to the initial goals set for the group, social workers can aim to improve members’ competency in navigating the features and functioning of the teleconferencing platforms (e.g., voting, raising one’s hand, the chat function, and the virtual whiteboard) through participating in the activities/games. Teaching members how to use these functions during the main discussion section saves time. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully arrange the order/sequence of the games. Social workers should introduce the features and functions of the communication platforms gradually, moving from easy to difficult, while keeping the stages of group development in mind, in order to build rapport and establish relationships with the members.

                        •	The instructor should pay more attention to members who are more shy and hesitant to share their thoughts. Increase their opportunities to engage and contribute by inviting them to participant in the activities. Helpers can also communicate with the instructor via text if they notice participants who are less involved in the group.

                        •	For activities related to art therapy or crafting, the instructor can zoom the camera in to give the participants a closer look at the artwork and better explain the procedures/steps.
